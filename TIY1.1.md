CChapter 1 Try It Yourself: Identify Variable Uses and Types

Activity Goal: Practice identifying variable types (e.g., float, text) and uses (quantitative or categorical) from a dataset.

✅ How to Use Gen AI to Help:
You can prompt Gen AI to walk you through the reasoning. Try starting with:

"Here is a list of variables with sample values. Help me identify each variable's type (text, float, integer, Boolean) and whether it's quantitative or categorical. Also explain why."

Paste in the data from the image.

Then, as you read its reply, try to justify each answer yourself before reading the explanation. You can also follow up with:

“Can you quiz me on a few examples?”

“What’s the difference between Boolean and categorical?”

“Is a numeric value always quantitative?”

This helps you move from just getting the answer to learning the underlying logic.
